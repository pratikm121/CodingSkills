The Goal
Win the race.

Rules
The circuit of the race is made up of checkpoints. 
To complete one lap, your vehicle (pod) must pass through each checkpoints in order and back through the start. 
The first player to reach the starting checkpoint on the final lap wins.

The pods work as follows:
To pass a checkpoint, the center of a pod must be inside the radius of the checkpoint.
To move a pod, you must print a target destination point followed by a thrust value. Details of the protocol can be found further down.
The thrust value of a pod is its acceleration and must be between 0 and 100.

Expert Rules
The game is played on a map 16000 units wide and 9000 units high. The coordinate X=0, Y=0 is the top left pixel.

The checkpoints work as follows:
The checkpoints are circular, with a radius of 600 units.
The disposition of the checkpoints is selected randomly for each race.
The pods work as follows:
If your pod does not reach the next checkpoint under 100 turns, you are eliminated and lose the game.
The pods may move normally outside the game area.

Note: You may activate debug mode in the settings panel () to view additional game data.
